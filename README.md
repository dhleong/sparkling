*Clojure/script LSP that sparks joy*

## What?

sparkling is a [Language Server Protocol][1] implementation for Clojure and
Clojurescript powered by [nREPL][2] when available and static analysis from
[clj-kondo][3] otherwise, enabling rich language features that work in any
editor that speaks LSP, whether you have nREPL set up or not---especially
helpful for [babashka][4] scripts.
